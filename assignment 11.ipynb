    "where file_name is a string that represents the name of the file and mode is a string that represents the\n",

    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Only): This mode opens a file for reading only. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Only): This mode opens a file for writing only. If the file exists, \n",

    "If the file exists, an error is raised. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",

    "The close() function is used to close a file in Python. Closing a file is \n",
    "important because it frees up the resources that were being used by the file. When a\n",
    "file is opened, the operating system reserves a certain amount of memory to store the\n",
    "contents of the file and also sets aside some other resources to handle the file. If a \n",
    "file is not closed, these resources remain in use even after you are done with the file,\n",
    "and this can cause problems, such as limiting the number of files you can have open at the\n",
    "same time or slowing down your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to freeing up resources, closing a file also ensures that \n",
    "any changes made to the file are saved. When you write to a file, the \n",
    "data is usually stored in a buffer in memory, and it is only written to\n",
    "the actual file when the buffer is flushed (for example, when the file is closed). \n",
    "If the file is not closed, any changes you made to the file may not be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is a good practice to close a file after you have finished using it. \n",

    "# read the file or make other operations with the file\n",
